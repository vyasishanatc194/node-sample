### Sequelize sample

### Installation

`npm install`

### Running

This example requires docker or a local MySQL installation.  If using a local MySQL database, see `app.module.ts` for credentials, and make sure there are matching credentials in the database and the source code.

#### Docker

There is a `docker-compose.yml` file for starting Docker.

`docker-compose up`

After running the sample, you can stop the Docker container with

`docker-compose down`

### Run the sample

Then, run Nest as usual:

`npm run start`



# Sequelize with NestJS Explanation

## Overview

Sequelize is a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js, providing a powerful and flexible way to interact with relational databases. This explanation will cover how to integrate Sequelize with NestJS.

## Installation

1. **Install Sequelize and Database Driver**:
   ```bash
   npm install sequelize sequelize-typescript mysql2
   ```

2. **Install NestJS Sequelize Package**:
   ```bash
   npm install @nestjs/sequelize sequelize
   ```

## Configuration

1. **Database Configuration**:
   - Configure your database connection in the `config/database.js` file.

2. **Sequelize Module in AppModule**:
   - Create a SequelizeModule in your `AppModule` with the necessary configurations.

## Sequelize Models

1. **Define Models**:
   - Define Sequelize models for your entities (tables) in the `models` directory.

2. **Associations**:
   - Define associations between models if your database has relationships.

## Sequelize Service

1. **Create a Service**:
   - Create a service that interacts with Sequelize models, providing methods for CRUD operations.

## Controllers

1. **Controller Methods**:
   - Create controllers with methods that utilize the Sequelize service to handle HTTP requests.

## Migrations

1. **Migration Files**:
   - Create migration files for database schema changes.
   - Example: `npx sequelize-cli migration:generate --name create-users`

2. **Run Migrations**:
   - Execute migrations to apply changes to the database.
   - Example: `npx sequelize-cli db:migrate`

## Seeders

1. **Seeder Files**:
   - Create seeder files for populating the database with initial data.
   - Example: `npx sequelize-cli seed:generate --name demo-user`

2. **Run Seeders**:
   - Execute seeders to insert data into the database.
   - Example: `npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all`

## Schema Design

1. **Define Database Schema**:
   - Plan your database schema, considering tables, relationships, and constraints.

2. **Implement Models**:
   - Implement Sequelize models based on the defined schema.

3. **Associations**:
   - Establish associations between models to represent relationships.

## Conclusion

Integrating Sequelize with NestJS involves configuring Sequelize in the `AppModule`, defining models, creating services and controllers, managing migrations for schema changes, and using seeders to populate the database. Ensure that the database schema design aligns with your application requirements.
