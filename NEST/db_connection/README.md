## Database Connection Configuration in NestJS

The `DbConnectionService` and `DbConnectionModule` in NestJS are designed to facilitate the configuration of the MongoDB database connection using the Mongoose ODM (Object-Document Mapper).

### DbConnectionService

The `DbConnectionService` is responsible for creating Mongoose options required to establish a connection with the MongoDB database. It implements the `MongooseOptionsFactory` interface and provides the `createMongooseOptions` method. In this method:

- It retrieves the MongoDB URI from the environment variables.
- It returns an options object containing the URI, along with additional Mongoose connection options like `useNewUrlParser` and `useUnifiedTopology`.

### DbConnectionModule

The `DbConnectionModule` is marked as `@Global()` to make the database connection globally accessible throughout the application. It uses the `MongooseModule.forRootAsync` method to asynchronously configure the MongoDB connection. It utilizes the `DbConnectionService` to dynamically generate the Mongoose options.

#### Configuration Details:

1. **URI Configuration:**
   - The MongoDB URI is fetched from the environment variable `MONGO_URI`.

2. **Mongoose Options:**
   - The Mongoose options include `useNewUrlParser` for improved URL parsing and `useUnifiedTopology` to opt-in for using the new Server Discovery and Monitoring engine.

3. **Exports:**
   - The `DbConnectionService` is both a provider and an export, making it available for injection throughout the application.

### How to Use

To use this database connection configuration in your NestJS application:

1. Import the `DbConnectionModule` into the desired module (usually the root or main application module).

   ```typescript
   import { DbConnectionModule } from './path-to-db-connection-module';
   
   @Module({
     imports: [DbConnectionModule],
     // other module configurations
   })
   export class YourModule {}
   ```

2. Ensure that the MongoDB URI is defined in your environment variables.

3. Mongoose will use the configured options to establish a connection when the application starts.

This modular approach simplifies database connection management in NestJS, promoting maintainability and reusability. The global scope allows easy access to the database connection throughout the entire application.
