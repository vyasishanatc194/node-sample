# Task Scheduling in NestJS

In the provided code, task scheduling is achieved using the `@nestjs/schedule` module in NestJS. This module allows you to define cron jobs, intervals, and timeouts to execute tasks at specified times or intervals.

## TasksService

The `TasksService` is an injectable service where task scheduling decorators are applied to methods that need to be executed at specified times or intervals.

- **Logger**: An instance of the `Logger` class is created to log messages related to task execution.

- **@Cron Decorator**: The `@Cron` decorator schedules the `handleCron` method to be executed based on a cron expression. In this case, it is configured to run every time the second is 45.

- **@Interval Decorator**: The `@Interval` decorator schedules the `handleInterval` method to be executed at regular intervals. It runs every 10 seconds.

- **@Timeout Decorator**: The `@Timeout` decorator schedules the `handleTimeout` method to be executed once after a specified timeout. It runs once after 5 seconds.

## AppModule

The `AppModule` is the root module of the NestJS application, and it imports the `ScheduleModule` from `@nestjs/schedule`.

- **ScheduleModule.forRoot()**: Configures the scheduling module to be used in the application.

- **TasksModule**: The `TasksModule` is imported, making the `TasksService` available for injection.

## Conclusion

Task scheduling in NestJS, provided by the `@nestjs/schedule` module, allows you to easily define and execute tasks at specified intervals or times. This is particularly useful for implementing recurring background jobs, cron jobs, or time-based tasks in your NestJS applications. The decorators `@Cron`, `@Interval`, and `@Timeout` make it straightforward to define the scheduling behavior for methods in your services.
