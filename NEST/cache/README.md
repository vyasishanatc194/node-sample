## Caching in NestJS

Caching in NestJS involves storing and retrieving data from a temporary storage location called a cache. Caching can significantly improve the performance of your application by reducing the time it takes to retrieve frequently requested data. NestJS provides a caching module that integrates with various caching libraries.

### Custom CacheInterceptor

The provided code includes a custom interceptor called `HttpCacheInterceptor`, which extends the built-in `CacheInterceptor`. This interceptor can be applied to specific routes or controllers to enable caching for those routes.

### `trackBy` Method

The `trackBy` method is overridden in `HttpCacheInterceptor` to determine the cache key based on the request context. It checks if the request is a GET request and if the request URL is not in the list of excluded paths. If conditions are met, it returns the request URL as the cache key; otherwise, it returns `undefined`.

### AppModule Configuration

In the `AppModule`, the `CacheModule` is imported from `@nestjs/cache-manager` and registered in the `imports` array. This sets up caching for the entire application.

### Applying the Interceptor

The `HttpCacheInterceptor` can be applied globally at the module level or locally at the controller or route level. In this code snippet, it is not explicitly applied to any specific route or controller. You would need to apply it where caching is desired.

### Exclude Paths

The `excludePaths` array is used to specify routes that should be excluded from caching. This allows you to customize which routes should or should not be cached.

### Usage Guidelines

To use caching in your NestJS application:

1. Import and register the `CacheModule` in your main module (`AppModule` in this case).
2. Create custom interceptors or use built-in ones like `CacheInterceptor` to handle caching logic.
3. Apply the interceptors to specific routes or controllers where caching is desired.

Remember to consider cache invalidation strategies and set appropriate cache durations based on your application's requirements. Caching is a powerful tool, but it requires careful consideration to avoid serving stale or outdated data.
