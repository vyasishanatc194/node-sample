# Fastify Adaptor in NestJS

Using Fastify as an adaptor with NestJS allows you to leverage the performance benefits of the Fastify web framework while still enjoying the productivity and simplicity of NestJS. Here's an explanation of various NestJS concepts and how they work with Fastify, without including code:

## Guards

- **Role-Based Access Control:**
  - Guards in NestJS can still be used with the Fastify adaptor to implement role-based access control. They can intercept requests and perform authorization checks before reaching the route handler.

## Interceptors

- **Response Transformation:**
  - Interceptors in NestJS can be applied to transform the response before it is sent to the client. This functionality is still applicable when using Fastify as the HTTP framework.

## Middleware

- **Request Processing:**
  - Middleware functions in NestJS can be used with the Fastify adaptor to execute logic before reaching the route handler. These functions have access to the request and response objects and can modify them as needed.

## Pipes

- **Request Validation:**
  - Pipes in NestJS are used for input validation and transformation. Even with the Fastify adaptor, you can apply pipes to validate and sanitize incoming request data before it is processed by your route handlers.

## Decorators

- **Metadata Annotation:**
  - Decorators in NestJS are used to annotate classes, methods, and properties with metadata. Fastify's integration with NestJS allows you to continue using decorators to provide metadata and configure various aspects of your application.

## Using Fastify Adaptor with NestJS

1. **Installation:**
   - Install the `@nestjs/platform-fastify` package to use Fastify as the HTTP framework with NestJS.

2. **Configuration:**
   - Configure NestJS to use Fastify by importing the `FastifyAdapter` and passing it to the `NestFactory.create()` method.

3. **Middleware, Guards, Interceptors, Pipes:**
   - Use middleware, guards, interceptors, and pipes as you would in a standard NestJS application. The Fastify adaptor seamlessly integrates these features.

4. **Performance Benefits:**
   - Enjoy the performance benefits of Fastify, such as low overhead and high throughput, while still leveraging the comprehensive feature set provided by NestJS.

By combining the strengths of NestJS and Fastify, you can build efficient and scalable applications with a modular structure, dependency injection, and a familiar programming model.
