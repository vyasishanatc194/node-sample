          A quick follow up to see if you have any questions about the payment verification process.
        </mj-text>

        <mj-text>
          By now, your bank should have received the two micro-deposits and post those these
          transactions. In case you still have not seen them posted on your bank statement. You can select
          the "Add Payment Method" by navigating to the Account Settings -> Payment Information
          section (under your name on the upper right corner after you logged in on the web).
          Once your bank account is added successfully, Stripe will make two small deposits, and you will
          need to enter the number of those small deposits to verify the transaction.
