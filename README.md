## Node Sample

This repository serves as a basic example of integrating Apollo Client with Express and Nest frameworks in a Node.js application.

### Technologies Used:

1. **Apollo Client**: Apollo Client is a comprehensive state management library for JavaScript applications that allows you to manage both local and remote data with GraphQL.[Link to README](./Apollo-Client/README.md)

2. **Express**: Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications.[Link to README](./EXPRESS/README.md)

3. **Nest**: Nest is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. It uses TypeScript and is heavily inspired by Angular.[Link to README](./NEST/README.md)

### Overview:

This sample application demonstrates how to integrate Apollo Client into a Node.js application built with Express and Nest frameworks. By combining these technologies, developers can efficiently manage client-server communication, handle routing, and implement GraphQL-based APIs.
